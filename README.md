# CitiBike-Leaflet-Project-3
Citi Bike Maps
In this activity, youâ€™ll use the Citi Bike API to get the status and location of every Citi Bike station in New York City. This activity also includes a bonus portion.

Instructions
Use the Citi Bike station information endpoint to get information about the station names and locations.Take a moment to study the data that the endpoint sends back in your browser. Note the following details:

 * Each object in the `stations` array has `station_id`, `name`, `capacity`, `lat`, and `lon` properties.

 * The [logic.js](Unsolved/static/js/logic.js) file contains coordinates that you can use to position a Leaflet map over New York City.
Create a function named createMap that takes bikeStations as an argument. This function will create both the tile layer and an overlay with the pins for each station.

Create a second function named createMarkers that will take response as an argument.

Using the response from a future D3 call, loop through the stations, and then create a marker to represent each station.

Give each marker a popup to display the name and capacity of its station.

In the createMarkers function, pass the resulting bike markers to the createmap function as a layerGroup.

Using D3, retrieve JSON data from the Citi Bike station information endpoint, and then call the createMarkers function. . The following image shows the map that results from these steps:

Bonus
If time allows, try the following bonus activity for an extra challenge. Follow these steps:

Write code to perform a second API call to the Citi Bike station status endpoint. Take a few moments to study the data that the endpoint returns. In particular, notice station_id, num_bikes_available, is_installed, and is_renting.

Using the data returned from the second API call, add the following functionality:

In the popup for each marker, display the number of available bikes.

Add a layer control, and then split the markers into these layer groups:

Coming Soon: This applies if a station isn't yet installed.

Empty Stations: This applies if a station has no available bikes.

Out of Order: This applies if a station is installed but not renting.

Low Stations: This applies if a station has less than five available bikes.

Healthy Stations: This applies if a marker doesn't fall into any of the previous layer groups.

Use a Leaflet plugin to create different types of markers to represent the layers. The following step shows an example map that uses Leaflet.ExtraMarkers. However, feel free to use another plugin if you prefer.

Add a legend to your map to explain the different markers. The following image shows an example of the final advanced map:

When you complete the app, deploy it to GitHub Pages.

Hint
Make sure that you run python -m http.server in the folder that contains your files. Because you'll do all the work on the front end of your app, you won't need to restart the router for any changes that you make.
